## The Problem

Tabletop RPG game masters spend hours curating playlists and manually triggering sound effects mid-session. It breaks immersion, splits focus, and most groups just skip audio entirely.

## The Solution

SuiteRhythm listens to what's happening at the table and **automatically** plays the right sounds at the right time — no manual input needed.

- A player says *"I kick down the tavern door"* — tavern ambiance fades in
- The DM describes a thunderstorm — rain and thunder start rolling
- Combat breaks out — the music shifts to battle drums

The GM stays in the story. The players stay immersed. The audio just works.

## How It Works

SuiteRhythm uses **speech recognition** to capture live conversation, sends it through an **AI analysis layer** (GPT-4o-mini), and maps the output to a curated library of **450+ sound effects and ambient tracks** — all in real time.

```
Voice Input → Speech Recognition → AI Context Analysis → Sound Matching → Playback
```

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Auto-Detect Mode** | Listens to live speech and triggers sounds automatically via AI |
| **Story Mode** | Pre-written narrative scenes with timed audio cues |
| **Sound Library** | 450+ categorized sounds — ambient, combat, weather, creatures, music |
| **Control Board** | Manual triggers for GMs who want direct control alongside auto-detect |
| **Smart Layering** | Multiple sounds play simultaneously with intelligent volume balancing |
| **Instant Response** | Sub-second latency from spoken word to audio playback |

## Market Opportunity

The tabletop RPG market has grown into a **$2B+ industry** (2025), fueled by actual-play content (Critical Role, Dimension 20) and the mainstreaming of D&D. Supporting tools — VTTs, digital maps, audio — are a fast-growing adjacent segment.

**No product on the market offers real-time, voice-reactive audio.**

Current alternatives require manual playlist management (Syrinscape, Tabletop Audio) or pre-configured triggers. SuiteRhythm is the first to close the loop between spoken narrative and dynamic audio — zero-touch.

### Target Users

- **Game Masters** running in-person or online TTRPG sessions
- **Actual-play streamers & podcasters** looking for production-quality audio
- **Game cafes & event organizers** hosting RPG nights
- **LARP & immersive experience designers**

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19 |
| **Audio Engine** | Howler.js — custom engine with layering, fading, preloading |
| **AI Analysis** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (server-side) |
| **Speech Recognition** | Web Speech API (native browser) |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| **Media Storage** | Cloudflare R2 (450+ audio files via CDN proxy) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (serverless, edge-optimized) |

## Traction & Status

- **Fully functional product** — live and playable today
- **450+ curated sound assets** hosted on CDN
- **AI pipeline operational** — real-time analysis with sub-second response
- **Zero-config user experience** — open the app and press play

## Business Model (Planned)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | Core auto-detect, limited sound library |
| **Pro** | $10/mo | Full library, story mode, custom sounds, priority AI |
| **Table License** | $20/mo | Multi-device sync, shared sessions, commercial use |

## Roadmap

- **Multi-device sync** — shared audio across a full table of players
- **Custom sound uploads** — bring your own audio library
- **VTT integrations** — Foundry VTT, Roll20, Owlbear Rodeo
- **Mobile companion app** — control board from your phone
- **Community marketplace** — user-created sound packs and story scenes

## External Controllers (`window.SuiteRhythm`)

SuiteRhythm exposes a small, stable command surface for external controllers — Stream Deck plugins, OBS browser sources, bookmarklets, webhooks, and anonymous Twitch chat. Every channel funnels into the same rate-limited handler, so your integration never depends on engine internals.

### Command channels

```js
// 1. Direct JS (same-page integrations / devtools)
await window.SuiteRhythm.trigger('thunder');                 // by name or id
await window.SuiteRhythm.trigger('rolling thunder', { volume: 0.8 });
await window.SuiteRhythm.stopAll();
await window.SuiteRhythm.scene('Combat');
window.SuiteRhythm.status();                                 // { mode, mood, listening, music, activeSounds, twitch }

// 2. CustomEvent (for modules that load before window.SuiteRhythm is attached)
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('suiterhythm:command', {
    detail: { type: 'trigger', query: 'thunder' }
}));

// 3. postMessage (OBS browser sources / iframes — origin-gated)
window.postMessage({ suiterhythm: 'trigger', query: 'thunder' }, '*');
```

All `trigger` calls resolve to `{ ok, name, soundId, url, source }` so you can later stop a specific instance with the engine API.

### Twitch chat bridge (no OAuth)

```js
window.SuiteRhythm.twitch.connect('aaronc1992');
// Viewers can now type in chat:
//   !sfx thunder       → plays a thunder SFX
//   !stop              → stops all audio
//   !scene Combat      → applies the Combat scene preset
window.SuiteRhythm.twitch.disconnect();
```

SuiteRhythm joins as an anonymous `justinfan*` user over Twitch's WebSocket IRC gateway — **read-only, no tokens, no chat writes**. Unknown bang-commands are ignored. Commands are rate-limited (500ms per `type:query` pair by default) so a chat flood can't thrash the audio graph.

### Rate limiting & origin allowlist

- Default rate limit: 500ms per command key.
- `postMessage` commands from cross-origin pages are rejected unless the origin is in `allowedOrigins` (set when constructing the bridge). Same-origin messages always pass.
- Unknown command types return `{ ok: false, error: 'unknown command' }` rather than throwing, so older clients don't crash when a newer bridge adds commands.
